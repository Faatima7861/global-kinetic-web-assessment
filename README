#Introduction/Test design
This is the web automation test project for https://www.saucedemo.com/ 
Developed using : Selenium and Java
Design : Page object model with page factories
Framework : TestNG 
IDE : Eclpise
Build : Maven 
Reporting : Extent report from Test NG 
Github Repo : https://github.com/Faatima7861/global-kinetic-web.git
Versions of software : Use latest if possible

#Get up and running locally 
1. Clone the project from gihub
2. Import into eclipse IDE 
3. Update project (Right click on pom.xml -> Maven -> Update Project) 
4. On Update being successful with successful downloading of dependencies you can run the project. 
5. Right click on testng.xml -> Run as -> TestNG Suite

#Potential errors that may occur : 
1. Local chrome driver and chromedriver.exe in the project are not the same version. Ensure they are the same. 
2. Chromedriver.exe in the project may be imported without write and execute permissions. 
3. Class paths not found. Try and update the project again. Check version of dependency it is complaining abaout. 

#Reporting
After successful test execution, The ExtentReporterNG.java class will create a folder in your user directory. 
The Reports folder will contain an index.html file that you can open in your browser. If you are unable to find this 
search your laptop for a Reports folder. 
If a Reports folder is not created, manually create one and re-run the test suite locally. 
The index.html file will then be generated in that location. 
Example of test result location locally : file:///Users/faatima/eclipse-workspace/DemoWorkspace/global-kinetic-web/Reports/index.html#

IF NEEDED : 
#Build project with jar file creation
Pom file must have final, target and all dependencies needed to build project via command line. 
After build ensure .jar files are created in target folder of project. (.jar name given in pom file) 
then run java -cp command - .jar file names are different for each project. 


#Build Project via terminal and have jar files created
cd /Users/faatima/eclipse-workspace/DemoWorkspace/global-kinetic-web (use your location)
mvn clean package -DskipTests

#Run jar files 
cd target
java -cp globalKineticWeb.jar:globalKineticWeb-tests.jar:libs/* org.testng.TestNG ../testng.xml

#Ignore 
Ignore dockerfile as project is not containerized yet
